# == Class zabbix::resources::agent
#
# This will create an resources into puppetdb
# for automatically configuring agent into
# zabbix front-end.
#
# === Requirements
#
# Nothing.
#
# When manage_resource is set to true, this class
# will be loaded from 'zabbix::agent'. So no need
# for loading this class manually.
